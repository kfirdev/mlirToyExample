## Mlir Example
The point of this project is to understand how does mlir works and how can I use it this will be some example operations
and maybe some a small parser for a language using these operations so I can perfectrly understand how to use mlir.

## Plan
The language should be a simple and easy to use begginer friendly lanuage, but behind the scenes using mlir passes
The language will be optimized to run as fast if not faster than other language, this will be done using heavy optimization passes.

## TODO
- [ ] Define the dialect.
- [ ] Create necessary operations.
- [ ] Create the passes.
