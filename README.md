## Mlir Example
The point of this project is to understand how does mlir works and how can I use it this will be some example operations
and maybe some a small parser for a language using these operations so I can perfectly understand how to use mlir.

## Plan
The language should be a simple and easy to use beginner friendly language, but behind the scenes using mlir passes
the language will be optimized to run as fast if not faster than other language, this will be done using heavy optimization passes.

## Supported features
The language supports basic types: int,float,bool and arrays for each type.
The language will support if, for and functions.

## Docs
Look at the docs folder for explanations
